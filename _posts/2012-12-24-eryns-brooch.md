Modeled after the leaf brooch worn in Lord of Rings. I like a new challenge in each forge project, but this presented several at once. Foremost was the time contraint, I started this with less than a week to go before Christmas. Also, I've never worked with brass, welded what was effectively sheet metal, or had to align so many tiny parts.
